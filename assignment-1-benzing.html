  <h1>System Analysis - Congress.gov</h1>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The information system I am going to analyze is the <a href=https://www.congress.gov>Congress.gov/</a> website. This website is used to serve both Congressional staffers and the everyday people. <a href=https://www.congress.gov>Congress.gov</a> provides information on a multitude of Congressional publications, which include:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Legislation</li>
 <li>Legislative texts</li>
 <li>Nominations</li>
 <li>The Congressional Record</li>
 <li>Treaty documents</li>
 <li>Slip Laws</li>
</ul>

   <p>When looking at this publications, <a href=https://www.congress.gov>congress.gov/</a> provides full texts, sponsrship information, and publication information. This allows these documents to be accessed and analyzed to the furthest extent.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p>When looking at legislation it provides the Congressmember who sponsors the bill, which committee the bill gets referred to, dates of the legislative history of the bill, as well as the full text.

Overall, it is a very large database and cannot be completely digested and analyzed in this one report. </p>

<p>There were a few things I thought were interesting about this database. One was that it included a long list of links to outside sources for Congressional staffers. These links can point to more condensed databases and information sources. Some of which is only accessible through Congressional networks. Some other things I thought were interesting were:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Hyperlinks to other governmental resources - some only accessible by those on Congressional/private networks.</li>
 <li>A large range of search options that can help to narrow search results</li>
 <li>Also contains CRS reports without having to access crs.gov</li>
<ol>

<p>There are also both pros and cons to using <a href=https://www.congress.gov/>Congress.gov</a></p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
 <il>Provides access to a lot of data and information within one database</li>
 <li>Spreads over both chambers of Congress</li>
 <li>Provides resources for Congressional staffers, including direct resources for House staffers and Senate Staffers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
 <li>Can be confusing to first time users</li>
 <li>Very daunting and intimidating when first visiting the site</li>
 <li>Assumes the user has prior knowledge of the legislative process and Congress.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Possible Improvements</h3>

<p>One improvement that can be made is to make the initial page less overwhelming by hiding the advanced search options or minimizing it to a smaller area on the site.</p>
